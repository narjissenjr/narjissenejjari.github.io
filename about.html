<h1>About</h1>

<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the <strong>National School of Computer Science and Systems Analysis (ENSIAS), Rabat</strong> and the <strong>International University of Rabat (UIR)</strong>, specializing in <strong>AI-driven cybersecurity analytics</strong>. My research focuses on <strong>AI-enabled methods for cyber threat detection, statistical modeling, and causal inference</strong>, aiming to improve decision-making under uncertainty in complex information systems.</p>
<p>I have extensive experience in <strong>teaching and mentoring</strong>, delivering courses in cybersecurity, programming, and machine learning, and supervising end-of-year student projects across multiple institutions.</p>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<ul>
  <li>AI-enabled Cybersecurity Analytics: Automatic cyber threat detection, cyber threat analysis, and privacy-preserving systems</li>
  <li>Statistical and Machine Learning Methodology</li>
  <li>Causal Explanation vs. Predictive Analytics: Balancing explanatory power with predictive performance</li>
  <li>Applications in Information Systems and Cybersecurity</li>
</ul>

<h2>Experience</h2>
<p>Before completing my Ph.D., I conducted research on <strong>data breaches, cybercrime analysis, and predictive modeling</strong> in various academic projects, collaborating with interdisciplinary teams. I have also contributed to <strong>research grant projects funded by NATO</strong> and presented at international conferences such as <strong>NETYS, SNAMS, and AIxIA</strong>.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ph.D. in Computer Science: AI-driven Cybersecurity (Expected June 2025), ENSIAS & UIR</li>
  <li>Master of Data Science and Big Data, ENSIAS, Mohammed V University, Rabat (October 2018)</li>
  <li>Bachelor in Mathematics and Computer Science, Mohammed Ist University, Oujda (December 2016)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Selected Publications</h2>
<ul>
  <li><em>PLS-SEM vs CB-SEM: Prediction-Oriented Solutions for Data Breaches</em> (submitted, 2025)</li>
  <li><em>A Times-Series Analysis of Geopolitical Cyber Threats: An Empirical Study</em> (submitted, 2025)</li>
  <li><em>Assessing Data Breach Factors Through the Lens of Modern Crime Theory: A Structural Equation Modeling Approach</em>, IEEE Access (2024)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Outside of Work</h2>
<p>I enjoy applying computational and statistical methods to real-world problems in cybersecurity, while mentoring young researchers and students interested in AI and security analytics.</p>
